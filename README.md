# SSGF [Super Small Game Framework]
SSGF is a 2D game framework written in C/C++ that is based off [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). The goal of this project is to create a small game framework that is stable and extensible.

# Development Goals
* Effective use of threads
* Efficient use of assets
* Rectangle and Circle Collision recognition 
* Game State/Sub-State management via Finite State Machine
* Sprite Rendering and Animation

# Disclamer
I have never developed a full game before, I've only messed around with SFML a few times and created some simple games like Pong and Dodger. There are going to be bugs, inefficiencies, and general weirdness to this code base in the initial stages while I learn how all this stuff works.

Resources that I utilize will be referenced below.
